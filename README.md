SFU CSSS Pop Orders
===================

### What?
The CSSS has the only Coke machine on campus and gets a fair amount
of traffic. It's important to keep it full and the stock cabinet filled.

### Who?
Pop orders are made by the **Directory of Resources**.<BR>
The pop machine can be filled by the DoR or the **Exec at Large**.

### When?
Pop orders are made on Monday, before 3 p.m.<BR>
Orders are received and paid for on Wednesday. The delivery guy
has a delivery window from 9 a.m. to noon for delivery. The DoR should
be available and in the common room for this time slot.<BR>

Make orders:
- Spring/Fall: Once a week.
- Summer: Once every two weeks.

### How?
We make orders by calling our personal Coke representative and telling
her what we need. Current info (as of 2014 June 11):

- Name:  Chantelle Neff

- Work:  604-472-7400

As she is often not in the office, it's best to call her cell.
